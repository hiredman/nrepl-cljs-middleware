#+TITLE: nrepl-cljs-middleware

* What is it?

nrepl middleware for compiling clojurescript

nrepl request with `op` of "compiler-cljs" causes `code` to be
compiled to javascript, the javascript is returned as the value of
`javascript`, wraps code in a function, so evaling the value of
`javascript` in js will always result in a function object, invoke it
to run your code

use with https://github.com/cemerick/drawbridge/ to get clojurescript
compiler with http interface

now if only there was an nrepl client for drawbridge written in clojurescript...

* Usage

add the following to project.clj

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[nrepl-cljs-middleware "0.0.1"]
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; with drawbridge

(def nrepl-handler (cdb/ring-handler
                    :nrepl-handler
                    (-> (clojure.tools.nrepl.server/default-handler)
                        nrepl.cljs.middleware.compile/compile-cljs)))

#+END_SRC

* Todo
  - needs better exception handling
  - js eval?
  - ast?
  - nrepl.el integration?
